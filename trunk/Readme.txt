This simple project demonstrates how you can use different IDEs and compilers to work with the same piece of code. This is useful in group projects where different people prefer to use different compilers/IDEs/OSs.

There is a single source file called Sys0.cpp in src folder. 

- The folder LinuxCompileTools contains a linux script file to compile and place the executible in bin folder.
- VC6ProjectFiles and VS2010ProjectFiles contain VC6 and VS2010 projects configured to compile and place the output exe into bin folder.
